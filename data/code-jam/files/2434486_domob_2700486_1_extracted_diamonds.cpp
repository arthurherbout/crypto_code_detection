/* CodeJam solution diamonds in C++ by domob.  */

/* Note that if a "triangle number" of diamonds falls, they will *always*
   form a triangle.  After that, further diamonds will slide down either side
   to fill up the next triangle from both sides until it is complete.  So
   after the final full triangle is formed, we only have to try out the
   possibilities for how many could fall left and how many of the remaining
   right.  Probably an even faster solution is possible (calculating the
   probability directly from the number of remaining diamonds and the
   size of the triangle, but I probably don't care about that.
   
   Triangle number means here that we have a "pyramid" formed with an odd
   number of rows.  Thus the contained numbers are:

   1
   1 + 2 + 3 = 6
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
