## Running the Application
The application is runnable per environment. Simply use the included makefile to clean, recompile all or recompile libraries.
__Note:__ The application requires $LINES and $COLUMNS to be available to the program. 
In your terminal, run: 
```
export LINES=$LINES; export COLUMNS=$COLUMNS
make clean && make all
./main.out h # Displays the help menu
./main.out g # Prints raindrops using a random string
```

### *Using make:*
* `make clean`, cleans all .o, .a and program generated files created during the compile process.
* `make all`, compiles all libraries and links them to the implementer (main.c).
* `make libraries`, compiles all libraries but doesn't link them, this is useful for debugging purposes. Otherwise, in typical use, simply call make all.

### *Chaining commands:*
* The usual double-ampersand (&&) used in bash allows chaining makefile commands;
	`make clean && make all`
