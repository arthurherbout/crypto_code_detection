 * Convert date and time to a wide-character string.
 *
 * This is the wide-character counterpart of strftime(). So that we do not
 * have to duplicate the code of strftime(), we convert the format string to
 * multibyte, call strftime(), then convert the result back into wide
 * characters.
 *
 * This technique loses in the presence of stateful multibyte encoding if any
 * of the conversions in the format string change conversion state. When
 * stateful encoding is implemented, we will need to reset the state between
 * format specifications in the format string.
 *
 * Note carefully that prior to xpg5, the format was char *, not wchar_t.
