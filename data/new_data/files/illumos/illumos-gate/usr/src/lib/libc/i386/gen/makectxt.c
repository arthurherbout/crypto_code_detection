/*
 * The original i386 ABI said that the stack pointer need be only 4-byte
 * aligned before a function call (STACK_ALIGN == 4).  The ABI supplement
 * version 1.0 changed the required alignment to 16-byte for the benefit of
 * floating point code compiled using sse2.  The compiler assumes this
 * alignment and maintains it for calls it generates.  If the stack is
 * initially properly aligned, it will continue to be so aligned.  If it is
 * not initially so aligned, it will never become so aligned.
 *
 * One slightly confusing detail to keep in mind is that the 16-byte
 * alignment (%esp & 0xf == 0) is true just *before* the call instruction.
 * The call instruction will then push a return value, decrementing %esp by
 * 4.  Therefore, if one dumps %esp at the at the very first instruction in
 * a function, it will end with a 0xc.  The compiler expects this and
 * compensates for it properly.
 *
 * Note: If you change this value, you need to change it in the following
 * files as well:
 *
 *  - lib/libc/i386/threads/machdep.c
 *  - lib/crt/i386/crti.s
 *  - lib/crt/i386/crt1.s
