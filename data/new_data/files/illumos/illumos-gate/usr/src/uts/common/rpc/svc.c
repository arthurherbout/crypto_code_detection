 *
 * Master transport handle (SVCMASTERXPRT).
 *   The master transport handle structure is shared among service
 *   threads processing events on the transport. Some fields in the
 *   master structure are protected by locks
 *   - xp_req_lock protects the request queue:
 *	xp_req_head, xp_req_tail, xp_reqs, xp_size, xp_full, xp_enable
 *   - xp_thread_lock protects the thread (clone) counts
 *	xp_threads, xp_detached_threads, xp_wq
 *   Each master transport is registered to exactly one thread pool.
 *
 * Clone transport handle (SVCXPRT)
 *   The clone transport handle structure is a per-service-thread handle
 *   to the transport. The structure carries all the fields/buffers used
 *   for request processing. A service thread or, in other words, a clone
 *   structure, can be linked to an arbitrary master structure to process
 *   requests on this transport. The master handle keeps track of reference
 *   counts of threads (clones) linked to it. A service thread can switch
 *   to another transport by unlinking its clone handle from the current
 *   transport and linking to a new one. Switching is relatively inexpensive
 *   but it involves locking (master's xprt->xp_thread_lock).
 *
 * Pools.
 *   A pool represents a kernel RPC service (NFS, Lock Manager, etc.).
 *   Transports related to the service are registered to the service pool.
 *   Service threads can switch between different transports in the pool.
 *   Thus, each service has its own pool of service threads. The maximum
 *   number of threads in a pool is pool->p_maxthreads. This limit allows
 *   to restrict resource usage by the service. Some fields are protected
 *   by locks:
 *   - p_req_lock protects several counts and flags:
 *	p_reqs, p_size, p_walkers, p_asleep, p_drowsy, p_req_cv
 *   - p_thread_lock governs other thread counts:
 *	p_threads, p_detached_threads, p_reserved_threads, p_closing
 *
 *   In addition, each pool contains a doubly-linked list of transports,
 *   an `xprt-ready' queue and a creator thread (see below). Threads in
 *   the pool share some other parameters such as stack size and
 *   polling timeout.
 *
 *   Pools are initialized through the svc_pool_create() function called from
 *   the nfssys() system call. However, thread creation must be done by
 *   the userland agent. This is done by using SVCPOOL_WAIT and
 *   SVCPOOL_RUN arguments to nfssys(), which call svc_wait() and
 *   svc_do_run(), respectively. Once the pool has been initialized,
 *   the userland process must set up a 'creator' thread. This thread
 *   should park itself in the kernel by calling svc_wait(). If
 *   svc_wait() returns successfully, it should fork off a new worker
 *   thread, which then calls svc_do_run() in order to get work. When
 *   that thread is complete, svc_do_run() will return, and the user
 *   program should call thr_exit().
 *
 *   When we try to register a new pool and there is an old pool with
 *   the same id in the doubly linked pool list (this happens when we kill
 *   and restart nfsd or lockd), then we unlink the old pool from the list
 *   and mark its state as `closing'. After that the transports can still
 *   process requests but new transports won't be registered. When all the
 *   transports and service threads associated with the pool are gone the
 *   creator thread (see below) will clean up the pool structure and exit.
 *
 * svc_queuereq() and svc_run().
 *   The kernel RPC server is interrupt driven. The svc_queuereq() interrupt
 *   routine is called to deliver an RPC request. The service threads
 *   loop in svc_run(). The interrupt function queues a request on the
 *   transport's queue and it makes sure that the request is serviced.
 *   It may either wake up one of sleeping threads, or ask for a new thread
 *   to be created, or, if the previous request is just being picked up, do
 *   nothing. In the last case the service thread that is picking up the
 *   previous request will wake up or create the next thread. After a service
 *   thread processes a request and sends a reply it returns to svc_run()
 *   and svc_run() calls svc_poll() to find new input.
 *
 * svc_poll().
 *   In order to avoid unnecessary locking, which causes performance
 *   problems, we always look for a pending request on the current transport.
 *   If there is none we take a hint from the pool's `xprt-ready' queue.
 *   If the queue had an overflow we switch to the `drain' mode checking
 *   each transport  in the pool's transport list. Once we find a
 *   master transport handle with a pending request we latch the request
 *   lock on this transport and return to svc_run(). If the request
 *   belongs to a transport different than the one the service thread is
 *   linked to we need to unlink and link again.
 *
 *   A service thread goes asleep when there are no pending
 *   requests on the transports registered on the pool's transports.
 *   All the pool's threads sleep on the same condition variable.
 *   If a thread has been sleeping for too long period of time
 *   (by default 5 seconds) it wakes up and exits.  Also when a transport
 *   is closing sleeping threads wake up to unlink from this transport.
 *
 * The `xprt-ready' queue.
 *   If a service thread finds no request on a transport it is currently linked
 *   to it will find another transport with a pending request. To make
 *   this search more efficient each pool has an `xprt-ready' queue.
 *   The queue is a FIFO. When the interrupt routine queues a request it also
 *   inserts a pointer to the transport into the `xprt-ready' queue. A
 *   thread looking for a transport with a pending request can pop up a
 *   transport and check for a request. The request can be already gone
 *   since it could be taken by a thread linked to that transport. In such a
 *   case we try the next hint. The `xprt-ready' queue has fixed size (by
 *   default 256 nodes). If it overflows svc_poll() has to switch to the
 *   less efficient but safe `drain' mode and walk through the pool's
 *   transport list.
 *
 *   Both the svc_poll() loop and the `xprt-ready' queue are optimized
 *   for the peak load case that is for the situation when the queue is not
 *   empty, there are all the time few pending requests, and a service
 *   thread which has just processed a request does not go asleep but picks
 *   up immediately the next request.
 *
 * Thread creator.
 *   Each pool has a thread creator associated with it. The creator thread
 *   sleeps on a condition variable and waits for a signal to create a
 *   service thread. The actual thread creation is done in userland by
 *   the method described in "Pools" above.
 *
 *   Signaling threads should turn on the `creator signaled' flag, and
 *   can avoid sending signals when the flag is on. The flag is cleared
 *   when the thread is created.
 *
 *   When the pool is in closing state (ie it has been already unregistered
 *   from the pool list) the last thread on the last transport in the pool
 *   should turn the p_creator_exit flag on. The creator thread will
 *   clean up the pool structure and exit.
 *
 * Thread reservation; Detaching service threads.
 *   A service thread can detach itself to block for an extended amount
 *   of time. However, to keep the service active we need to guarantee
 *   at least pool->p_redline non-detached threads that can process incoming
 *   requests. This, the maximum number of detached and reserved threads is
 *   p->p_maxthreads - p->p_redline. A service thread should first acquire
 *   a reservation, and if the reservation was granted it can detach itself.
 *   If a reservation was granted but the thread does not detach itself
 *   it should cancel the reservation before it returns to svc_run().

 *
 * On input the xprt->xp_full determines whether the flow control is currently
 * off (FALSE) or on (TRUE).  If it is off we do tests to see whether we should
 * turn it on, and vice versa.
 *
 * There are two conditions considered for the flow control.  Both conditions
 * have the low and the high watermark.  Once the high watermark is reached in
 * EITHER condition the flow control is turned on.  For turning the flow
 * control off BOTH conditions must be below the low watermark.
 *
 * Condition #1 - Number of requests queued:
 *
 * The max number of threads working on the pool is roughly pool->p_maxthreads.
 * Every thread could handle up to pool->p_max_same_xprt requests from one
 * transport before it moves to another transport.  See svc_poll() for details.
 * In case all threads in the pool are working on a transport they will handle
 * no more than enough_reqs (pool->p_maxthreads * pool->p_max_same_xprt)
 * requests in one shot from that transport.  We are turning the flow control
 * on once the high watermark is reached for a transport so that the underlying
 * queue knows the rate of incoming requests is higher than we are able to
 * handle.
 *
 * The high watermark: 2 * enough_reqs
 * The low watermark: enough_reqs
 *
 * Condition #2 - Length of the data payload for the queued messages/requests:
 *
 * We want to prevent a particular pool exhausting the memory, so once the
 * total length of queued requests for the whole pool reaches the high
 * watermark we start to turn on the flow control for significant memory
 * consumers (individual transports).  To keep the implementation simple
 * enough, this condition is not exact, because we count only the data part of
 * the queued requests and we ignore the overhead.  For our purposes this
 * should be enough.  We should also consider that up to pool->p_maxthreads
 * threads for the pool might work on large requests (this is not counted for
 * this condition).  We need to leave some space for rest of the system and for
 * other big memory consumers (like ZFS).  Also, after the flow control is
 * turned on (on cots transports) we can start to accumulate a few megabytes in
 * queues for each transport.
 *
 * Usually, the big memory consumers are NFS WRITE requests, so we do not
 * expect to see this condition met for other than NFS pools.
 *
 * The high watermark: 1/5 of available memory
 * The low watermark: 1/6 of available memory
 *
 * Once the high watermark is reached we turn the flow control on only for
 * transports exceeding a per-transport memory limit.  The per-transport
 * fraction of memory is calculated as:
 *
 * the high watermark / number of transports
 *
 * For transports with less than the per-transport fraction of memory consumed,
 * the flow control is not turned on, so they are not blocked by a few "hungry"
 * transports.  Because of this, the total memory consumption for the
 * particular pool might grow up to 2 * the high watermark.
 *
 * The individual transports are unblocked once their consumption is below:
 *
 * per-transport fraction of memory / 2
 *
 * or once the total memory consumption for the whole pool falls below the low
 * watermark.
