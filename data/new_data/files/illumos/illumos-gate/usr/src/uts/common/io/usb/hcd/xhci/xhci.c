 * Extensible Host Controller Interface (xHCI) USB Driver
 *
 * The xhci driver is an HCI driver for USB that bridges the gap between client
 * device drivers and implements the actual way that we talk to devices. The
 * xhci specification provides access to USB 3.x capable devices, as well as all
 * prior generations. Like other host controllers, it both provides the way to
 * talk to devices and also is treated like a hub (often called the root hub).
 *
 * This driver is part of the USBA (USB Architecture). It implements the HCDI
 * (host controller device interface) end of USBA. These entry points are used
 * by the USBA on behalf of client device drivers to access their devices. The
 * driver also provides notifications to deal with hot plug events, which are
 * quite common in USB.
 *
 * ----------------
 * USB Introduction
 * ----------------
 *
 * To properly understand the xhci driver and the design of the USBA HCDI
 * interfaces it implements, it helps to have a bit of background into how USB
 * devices are structured and understand how they work at a high-level.
 *
 * USB devices, like PCI devices, are broken down into different classes of
 * device. For example, with USB you have hubs, human-input devices (keyboards,
 * mice, etc.), mass storage, etc. Every device also has a vendor and device ID.
 * Many client drivers bind to an entire class of device, for example, the hubd
 * driver (to hubs) or scsa2usb (USB storage). However, there are other drivers
 * that bind to explicit IDs such as usbsprl (specific USB to Serial devices).
 *
 * USB SPEEDS AND VERSIONS
 *
 * USB devices are often referred to in two different ways. One way they're
 * described is with the USB version that they conform to. In the wild, you're
 * most likely going to see USB 1.1, 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0. However, you may also
 * see devices referred to as 'full-', 'low-', 'high-', and 'super-' speed
 * devices.
 *
 * The latter description describes the maximum theoretical speed of a given
 * device. For example, a super-speed device theoretically caps out around 5
 * Gbit/s, whereas a low-speed device caps out at 1.5 Mbit/s.
 *
 * In general, each speed usually corresponds to a specific USB protocol
 * generation. For example, all USB 3.0 devices are super-speed devices. All
 * 'high-speed' devices are USB 2.x devices. Full-speed devices are special in
 * that they can either be USB 1.x or USB 2.x devices. Low-speed devices are
 * only a USB 1.x thing, they did not jump the fire line to USB 2.x.
 *
 * USB 3.0 devices and ports generally have the wiring for both USB 2.0 and USB
 * 3.0. When a USB 3.x device is plugged into a USB 2.0 port or hub, then it
 * will report its version as USB 2.1, to indicate that it is actually a USB 3.x
 * device.
 *
 * USB ENDPOINTS
 *
 * A given USB device is made up of endpoints. A request, or transfer, is made
 * to a specific USB endpoint. These endpoints can provide different services
 * and have different expectations around the size of the data that'll be used
 * in a given request and the periodicity of requests. Endpoints themselves are
 * either used to make one-shot requests, for example, making requests to a mass
 * storage device for a given sector, or for making periodic requests where you
 * end up polling on the endpoint, for example, polling on a USB keyboard for
 * keystrokes.
 *
 * Each endpoint encodes two different pieces of information: a direction and a
 * type. There are two different directions: IN and OUT. These refer to the
 * general direction that data moves relative to the operating system. For
 * example, an IN transfer transfers data in to the operating system, from the
 * device. An OUT transfer transfers data from the operating system, out to the
 * device.
 *
 * There are four different kinds of endpoints:
 *
 *	BULK		These transfers are large transfers of data to or from
 *			a device. The most common use for bulk transfers is for
 *			mass storage devices. Though they are often also used by
 *			network devices and more. Bulk endpoints do not have an
 *			explicit time component to them. They are always used
 *			for one-shot transfers.
 *
 *	CONTROL		These transfers are used to manipulate devices
 *			themselves and are used for USB protocol level
 *			operations (whether device-specific, class-specific, or
 *			generic across all of USB). Unlike other transfers,
 *			control transfers are always bi-directional and use
 *			different kinds of transfers.
 *
 *	INTERRUPT	Interrupt transfers are used for small transfers that
 *			happen infrequently, but need reasonable latency. A good
 *			example of interrupt transfers is to receive input from
 *			a USB keyboard. Interrupt-IN transfers are generally
 *			polled. Meaning that a client (device driver) opens up
 *			an interrupt-IN pipe to poll on it, and receives
 *			periodic updates whenever there is information
 *			available. However, Interrupt transfers can be used
 *			as one-shot transfers both going IN and OUT.
 *
 *	ISOCHRONOUS	These transfers are things that happen once per
 *			time-interval at a very regular rate. A good example of
 *			these transfers are for audio and video. A device may
 *			describe an interval as 10ms at which point it will read
 *			or write the next batch of data every 10ms and transform
 *			it for the user. There are no one-shot Isochronous-IN
 *			transfers. There are one-shot Isochronous-OUT transfers,
 *			but these are used by device drivers to always provide
 *			the system with sufficient data.
 *
 * To find out information about the endpoints, USB devices have a series of
 * descriptors that cover different aspects of the device. For example, there
 * are endpoint descriptors which cover the properties of endpoints such as the
 * maximum packet size or polling interval.
 *
 * Descriptors exist at all levels of USB. For example, there are general
 * descriptors for every device. The USB device descriptor is described in
 * usb_dev_descr(9S). Host controllers will look at these descriptors to ensure
 * that they program the device correctly; however, they are more often used by
 * client device drivers. There are also descriptors that exist at a class
 * level. For example, the hub class has a class-specific descriptor which
 * describes properties of the hub. That information is requested for and used
 * by the hub driver.
 *
 * All of the different descriptors are gathered by the system and placed into a
 * tree which USBA sometimes calls the 'Configuration Cloud'. Client device
 * drivers gain access to this cloud and then use them to open endpoints, which
 * are called pipes in USBA (and some revisions of the USB specification).
 *
 * Each pipe gives access to a specific endpoint on the device which can be used
 * to perform transfers of a specific type and direction. For example, a mass
 * storage device often has three different endpoints, the default control
 * endpoint (which every device has), a Bulk-IN endpoint, and a Bulk-OUT
 * endpoint. The device driver ends up with three open pipes. One to the default
 * control endpoint to configure the device, and then the other two are used to
 * perform I/O.
 *
 * These routines translate more or less directly into calls to a host
 * controller driver. A request to open a pipe takes an endpoint descriptor that
 * describes the properties of the pipe, and the host controller driver (this
 * driver) goes through and does any work necessary to allow the client device
 * driver to access it. Once the pipe is open, it either makes one-shot
 * transfers specific to the transfer type or it starts performing a periodic
 * poll of an endpoint.
 *
 * All of these different actions translate into requests to the host
 * controller. The host controller driver itself is in charge of making sure
 * that all of the required resources for polling are allocated with a request
 * and then proceed to give the driver's periodic callbacks.
 *
 * HUBS AND HOST CONTROLLERS
 *
 * Every device is always plugged into a hub, even if the device is itself a
 * hub. This continues until we reach what we call the root-hub. The root-hub is
 * special in that it is not an actual USB hub, but is integrated into the host
 * controller and is manipulated in its own way. For example, the host
 * controller is used to turn on and off a given port's power. This may happen
 * over any interface, though the most common way is through PCI.
 *
 * In addition to the normal character device that exists for a host controller
 * driver, as part of attaching, the host controller binds to an instance of the
 * hubd driver. While the root-hub is a bit of a fiction, everyone models the
 * root-hub as the same as any other hub that's plugged in. The hub kernel
 * module doesn't know that the hub isn't a physical device that's been plugged
 * in. The host controller driver simulates that view by taking hub requests
 * that are made and translating them into corresponding requests that are
 * understood by the host controller, for example, reading and writing to a
 * memory mapped register.
 *
 * The hub driver polls for changes in device state using an Interrupt-IN
 * request, which is the same as is done for the root-hub. This allows the host
 * controller driver to not have to know about the implementation of device hot
 * plug, merely react to requests from a hub, the same as if it were an external
 * device. When the hub driver detects a change, it will go through the
 * corresponding state machine and attach or detach the corresponding client
 * device driver, depending if the device was inserted or removed.
 *
 * We detect the changes for the Interrupt-IN primarily based on the port state
 * change events that are delivered to the event ring. Whenever any event is
 * fired, we use this to update the hub driver about _all_ ports with
 * outstanding events. This more closely matches how a hub is supposed to behave
 * and leaves things less likely for the hub driver to end up without clearing a
 * flag on a port.
 *
 * PACKET SIZES AND BURSTING
 *
 * A given USB endpoint has an explicit packet size and a number of packets that
 * can be sent per time interval. These concepts are abstracted away from client
 * device drives usually, though they sometimes inform the upper bounds of what
 * a device can perform.
 *
 * The host controller uses this information to transform arbitrary transfer
 * requests into USB protocol packets. One of the nice things about the host
 * controllers is that they abstract away all of the signaling and semantics of
 * the actual USB protocols, allowing for life to be slightly easier in the
 * operating system.
 *
 * That said, if the host controller is not programmed correctly, these can end
 * up causing transaction errors and other problems in response to the data that
 * the host controller is trying to send or receive.
 *
 * ------------
 * Organization
 * ------------
 *
 * The driver is made up of the following files. Many of these have their own
 * theory statements to describe what they do. Here, we touch on each of the
 * purpose of each of these files.
 *
 * xhci_command.c:	This file contains the logic to issue commands to the
 *			controller as well as the actual functions that the
 *			other parts of the driver use to cause those commands.
 *
 * xhci_context.c:	This file manages various data structures used by the
 *			controller to manage the controller's and device's
 *			context data structures. See more in the xHCI Overview
 *			and General Design for more information.
 *
 * xhci_dma.c:		This manages the allocation of DMA memory and DMA
 *			attributes for controller, whether memory is for a
 *			transfer or something else. This file also deals with
 *			all the logic of getting data in and out of DMA buffers.
 *
 * xhci_endpoint.c:	This manages all of the logic of handling endpoints or
 *			pipes. It deals with endpoint configuration, I/O
 *			scheduling, timeouts, and callbacks to USBA.
 *
 * xhci_event.c:	This manages callbacks from the hardware to the driver.
 *			This covers command completion notifications and I/O
 *			notifications.
 *
 * xhci_hub.c:		This manages the virtual root-hub. It basically
 *			implements and translates all of the USB level requests
 *			into xhci specific implements. It also contains the
 *			functions to register this hub with USBA.
 *
 * xhci_intr.c:		This manages the underlying interrupt allocation,
 *			interrupt moderation, and interrupt routines.
 *
 * xhci_quirks.c:	This manages information about buggy hardware that's
 *			been collected and experienced primarily from other
 *			systems.
 *
 * xhci_ring.c:		This manages the abstraction of a ring in xhci, which is
 *			the primary of communication between the driver and the
 *			hardware, whether for the controller or a device.
 *
 * xhci_usba.c:		This implements all of the HCDI functions required by
 *			USBA. This is the main entry point that drivers and the
 *			kernel frameworks will reach to start any operation.
 *			Many functions here will end up in the command and
 *			endpoint code.
 *
 * xhci.c:		This provides the main kernel DDI interfaces and
 *			performs device initialization.
 *
 * xhci_polled.c:	This provides the polled I/O functions that the
 *			kernel debugger can use.
 *
 * xhci.h:		This is the primary header file which defines
 *			illumos-specific data structures and constants to manage
 *			the system.
 *
 * xhcireg.h:		This header file defines all of the register offsets,
 *			masks, and related macros. It also contains all of the
 *			constants that are used in various structures as defined
 *			by the specification, such as command offsets, etc.
 *
 * xhci_ioctl.h:	This contains a few private ioctls that are used by a
 *			private debugging command. These are private.
 *
 * cmd/xhci/xhci_portsc:	This is a private utility that can be useful for
 *				debugging xhci state. It is the only consumer of
 *				xhci_ioctl.h and the private ioctls.
 *
 * ----------------------------------
 * xHCI Overview and Structure Layout
 * ----------------------------------
 *
 * The design and structure of this driver follows from the way that the xHCI
 * specification tells us that we have to work with hardware. First we'll give a
 * rough summary of how that works, though the xHCI 1.1 specification should be
 * referenced when going through this.
 *
 * There are three primary parts of the hardware -- registers, contexts, and
 * rings. The registers are memory mapped registers that come in four sets,
 * though all are found within the first BAR. These are used to program and
 * control the hardware and aspects of the devices. Beyond more traditional
 * device programming there are two primary sets of registers that are
 * important:
 *
 *   o Port Status and Control Registers (XHCI_PORTSC)
 *   o Doorbell Array (XHCI_DOORBELL)
 *
 * The port status and control registers are used to get and manipulate the
 * status of a given device. For example, turning on and off the power to it.
 * The Doorbell Array is used to kick off I/O operations and start the
 * processing of an I/O ring.
 *
 * The contexts are data structures that represent various pieces of information
 * in the controller. These contexts are generally filled out by the driver and
 * then acknowledged and consumed by the hardware. There are controller-wide
 * contexts (mostly managed in xhci_context.c) that are used to point to the
 * contexts that exist for each device in the system. The primary context is
 * called the Device Context Base Address Array (DCBAA).
 *
 * Each device in the system is allocated a 'slot', which is used to index into
 * the DCBAA. Slots are assigned based on issuing commands to the controller.
 * There are a fixed number of slots that determine the maximum number of
 * devices that can end up being supported in the system. Note this includes all
 * the devices plugged into the USB device tree, not just devices plugged into
 * ports on the chassis.
 *
 * For each device, there is a context structure that describes properties of
 * the device. For example, what speed is the device, is it a hub, etc. The
 * context has slots for the device and for each endpoint on the device. As
 * endpoints are enabled, their context information which describes things like
 * the maximum packet size, is filled in and enabled. The mapping between these
 * contexts look like:
 *
 *
 *      DCBAA
 *    +--------+                    Device Context
 *    | Slot 0 |------------------>+--------------+
 *    +--------+                   | Slot Context |
 *    |  ...   |                   +--------------+       +----------+
 *    +--------+   +------+        |  Endpoint 0  |------>| I/O Ring |
 *    | Slot n |-->| NULL |        | Context (Bi) |       +----------+
 *    +--------+   +------+        +--------------+
 *                                 |  Endpoint 1  |
 *                                 | Context (Out)|
 *                                 +--------------+
 *                                 |  Endpoint 1  |
 *                                 | Context (In) |
 *                                 +--------------+
 *                                 |      ...     |
 *                                 +--------------+
 *                                 | Endpoint 15  |
 *                                 | Context (In) |
 *                                 +--------------+
 *
 * These contexts are always owned by the controller, though we can read them
 * after various operations complete. Commands that toggle device state use a
 * specific input context, which is a variant of the device context. The only
 * difference is that it has an input context structure ahead of it to say which
 * sections of the device context should be evaluated.
 *
 * Each active endpoint points us to an I/O ring, which leads us to the third
 * main data structure that's used by the device: rings. Rings are made up of
 * transfer request blocks (TRBs), which are joined together to form a given
 * transfer description (TD) which represents a single I/O request.
 *
 * These rings are used to issue I/O to individual endpoints, to issue commands
 * to the controller, and to receive notification of changes and completions.
 * Issued commands go on the special ring called the command ring while the
 * change and completion notifications go on the event ring.  More details are
 * available in xhci_ring.c. Each of these structures is represented by an
 * xhci_ring_t.
 *
 * Each ring can be made up of one or more disjoint regions of DMA; however, we
 * only use a single one. This also impacts some additional registers and
 * structures that exist. The event ring has an indirection table called the
 * Event Ring Segment Table (ERST). Each entry in the table (a segment)
 * describes a chunk of the event ring.
 *
 * One other thing worth calling out is the scratchpad. The scratchpad is a way
 * for the controller to be given arbitrary memory by the OS that it can use.
 * There are two parts to the scratchpad. The first part is an array whose
 * entries contain pointers to the actual addresses for the pages. The second
 * part that we allocate are the actual pages themselves.
 *
 * -----------------------------
 * Endpoint State and Management
 * -----------------------------
 *
 * Endpoint management is one of the key parts to the xhci driver as every
 * endpoint is a pipe that a device driver uses, so they are our primary
 * currency. Endpoints are enabled and disabled when the client device drivers
 * open and close a pipe. When an endpoint is enabled, we have to fill in an
 * endpoint's context structure with information about the endpoint. These
 * basically tell the controller important properties which it uses to ensure
 * that there is adequate bandwidth for the device.
 *
 * Each endpoint has its own ring as described in the previous section. We place
 * TRBs (transfer request blocks) onto a given ring to request I/O be performed.
 * Responses are placed on the event ring, in other words, the rings associated
 * with an endpoint are purely for producing I/O.
 *
 * Endpoints have a defined state machine as described in xHCI 1.1 / 4.8.3.
 * These states generally correspond with the state of the endpoint to process
 * I/O and handle timeouts. The driver basically follows a similar state machine
 * as described there. There are some deviations. For example, what they
 * describe as 'running' we break into both the Idle and Running states below.
 * We also have a notion of timed out and quiescing. The following image
 * summarizes the states and transitions:
 *
 *     +------+                                +-----------+
 *     | Idle |---------*--------------------->|  Running  |<-+
 *     +------+         . I/O queued on        +-----------+  |
 *        ^               ring and timeout        |  |  |     |
 *        |               scheduled.              |  |  |     |
 *        |                                       |  |  |     |
 *        +-----*---------------------------------+  |  |     |
 *        |     . No I/Os remain                     |  |     |
 *        |                                          |  |     |
 *        |                +------*------------------+  |     |
 *        |                |      . Timeout             |     |
 *        |                |        fires for           |     |
 *        |                |        I/O                 |     |
 *        |                v                            v     |
 *        |          +-----------+                +--------+  |
 *        |          | Timed Out |                | Halted |  |
 *        |          +-----------+                +--------+  |
 *        |             |                           |         |
 *        |             |   +-----------+           |         |
 *        |             +-->| Quiescing |<----------+         |
 *        |                 +-----------+                     |
 *        |   No TRBs.           |                . TRBs      |
 *        |   remain .           |                . Remain    |
 *        +----------*----<------+-------->-------*-----------+
 *
 * Normally, a given endpoint will oscillate between having TRBs scheduled and
 * not. Every time a new I/O is added to the endpoint, we'll ring the doorbell,
 * making sure that we're processing the ring, presuming that the endpoint isn't
 * in one of the error states.
 *
 * To detect device hangs, we have an active timeout(9F) per active endpoint
 * that ticks at a one second rate while we still have TRBs outstanding on an
 * endpoint. Once all outstanding TRBs have been processed, the timeout will
 * stop itself and there will be no active checking until the endpoint has I/O
 * scheduled on it again.
 *
 * There are two primary ways that things can go wrong on the endpoint. We can
 * either have a timeout or an event that transitions the endpoint to the Halted
 * state. In the halted state, we need to issue explicit commands to reset the
 * endpoint before removing the I/O.
 *
 * The way we handle both a timeout and a halted condition is similar, but the
 * way they are triggered is different. When we detect a halted condition, we
 * don't immediately clean it up, and wait for the client device driver (or USBA
 * on its behalf) to issue a pipe reset. When we detect a timeout, we
 * immediately take action (assuming no other action is ongoing).
 *
 * In both cases, we quiesce the device, which takes care of dealing with taking
 * the endpoint from whatever state it may be in and taking the appropriate
 * actions based on the state machine in xHCI 1.1 / 4.8.3. The end of quiescing
 * leaves the device stopped, which allows us to update the ring's pointer and
 * remove any TRBs that are causing problems.
 *
 * As part of all this, we ensure that we can only be quiescing the device from
 * a given path at a time. Any requests to schedule I/O during this time will
 * generally fail.
 *
 * The following image describes the state machine for the timeout logic. It
 * ties into the image above.
 *

 *
 * As we described above, when there are active TRBs and I/Os, a 1 second
 * timeout(9F) will be active. Each second, we decrement a counter on the
 * current, active I/O until either a new I/O takes the head, or the counter
 * reaches zero. If the counter reaches zero, then we go through, quiesce the
 * ring, and then clean things up.
 *
 * ------------------
 * Periodic Endpoints
 * ------------------
 *
 * It's worth calling out periodic endpoints explicitly, as they operate
 * somewhat differently. Periodic endpoints are limited to Interrupt-IN and
 * Isochronous-IN. The USBA often uses the term polling for these. That's
 * because the client only needs to make a single API call; however, they'll
 * receive multiple callbacks until either an error occurs or polling is
 * requested to be terminated.
 *
 * When we have one of these periodic requests, we end up always rescheduling
 * I/O requests, as well as, having a specific number of pre-existing I/O
 * requests to cover the periodic needs, in case of latency spikes. Normally,
 * when replying to a request, we use the request handle that we were given.
 * However, when we have a periodic request, we're required to duplicate the
 * handle before giving them data.
 *
 * However, the duplication is a bit tricky. For everything that was duplicated,
 * the framework expects us to submit data. Because of that we, don't duplicate
 * them until they are needed. This minimizes the likelihood that we have
 * outstanding requests to deal with when we encounter a fatal polling failure.
 *
 * Most of the polling setup logic happens in xhci_usba.c in
 * xhci_hcdi_periodic_init(). The consumption and duplication is handled in
 * xhci_endpoint.c.
 *
 * ----------------
 * Structure Layout
 * ----------------
 *
 * The following images relate the core data structures. The primary structure
 * in the system is the xhci_t. This is the per-controller data structure that
 * exists for each instance of the driver. From there, each device in the system
 * is represented by an xhci_device_t and each endpoint is represented by an
 * xhci_endpoint_t. For each client that opens a given endpoint, there is an
 * xhci_pipe_t. For each I/O related ring, there is an xhci_ring_t in the
 * system.

 * -------------
 * Lock Ordering
 * -------------
 *
 * There are three different tiers of locks that exist in the driver. First,
 * there is a lock for each controller: xhci_t`xhci_lock. This protects all the
 * data for that instance of the controller. If there are multiple instances of
 * the xHCI controller in the system, each one is independent and protected
 * separately. The two do not share any data.
 *
 * From there, there are two other, specific locks in the system:
 *
 *   o xhci_command_ring_t`xcr_lock
 *   o xhci_device_t`xd_imtx
 *
 * There is only one xcr_lock per controller, like the xhci_lock. It protects
 * the state of the command ring. However, there is on xd_imtx per device.
 * Recall that each device is scoped to a given controller. This protects the
 * input slot context for a given device.
 *
 * There are a few important rules to keep in mind here that are true
 * universally throughout the driver:
 *
 * 1) Always grab the xhci_t`xhci_lock, before grabbing any of the other locks.
 * 2) A given xhci_device_t`xd_imtx, must be taken before grabbing the
 *    xhci_command_ring_t`xcr_lock.
 * 3) A given thread can only hold one of the given xhci_device_t`xd_imtx locks
 *    at a given time. In other words, we should never be manipulating the input
 *    context of two different devices at once.
 * 4) It is safe to hold the xhci_device_t`xd_imtx while tearing down the
 *    endpoint timer. Conversely, the endpoint specific logic should never enter
 *    this lock.
 *
 * ----------
 * Polled I/O
 * ----------
 *
 * There is limited support for polled I/O in this driver for use by
 * the kernel debugger. The driver currently only supports input from
 * interrupt endpoints which is good enough for USB HID keyboard devices.
 * Input from bulk endpoints and output are not supported which prevents
 * using a serial console over USB for kernel debugging.
 *
 * --------------------
 * Relationship to EHCI
 * --------------------
 *
 * On some Intel chipsets, a given physical port on the system may be routed to
 * one of the EHCI or xHCI controllers. This association can be dynamically
 * changed by writing to platform specific registers as handled by the quirk
 * logic in xhci_quirk.c.
 *
 * As these ports may support USB 3.x speeds, we always route all such ports to
 * the xHCI controller, when supported. In addition, to minimize disruptions
 * from devices being enumerated and attached to the EHCI driver and then
 * disappearing, we generally attempt to load the xHCI controller before the
 * EHCI controller. This logic is not done in the driver; however, it is done in
 * other parts of the kernel like in uts/common/io/consconfig_dacf.c in the
 * function consconfig_load_drivres().
 *
 * -----------
 * Future Work
 * -----------
 *
 * The primary future work in this driver spans two different, but related
 * areas. The first area is around controller resets and how they tie into FM.
 * Presently, we do not have a good way to handle controllers coming and going
 * in the broader USB stack or properly reconfigure the device after a reset.
 * Secondly, we don't handle the suspend and resume of devices and drivers.
