 * The microfind() routine is used to calibrate the delay provided by
 * tenmicrosec().  Early in boot gethrtime() is not yet configured and
 * available for accurate delays, but some drivers still need to be able to
 * pause execution for rough increments of ten microseconds.  To that end,
 * microfind() will measure the wall time elapsed during a simple delay loop
 * using the Intel 8254 Programmable Interval Timer (PIT), and attempt to find
 * a loop count that approximates a ten microsecond delay.
 *
 * This mechanism is accurate enough when running unvirtualised on real CPUs,
 * but is somewhat less efficacious in a virtual machine.  In a virtualised
 * guest the relationship between instruction completion and elapsed wall time
 * is, at best, variable; on such machines the calibration is merely a rough
 * guess.
