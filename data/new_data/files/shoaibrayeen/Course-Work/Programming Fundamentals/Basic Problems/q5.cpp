/*
output : B

The "trick" here is that B::f() is called even though it is private.

As ยง11.5.2 in the standard puts it: "Access is checked at the call point using the type of the expression used 
to denote the object for which the member function is called". The call point here being a.f(), and the type of 
the expression is A&.
