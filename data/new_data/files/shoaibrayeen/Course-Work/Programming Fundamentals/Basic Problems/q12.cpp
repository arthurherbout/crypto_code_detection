/*
  output : TS
  "When looking for the declaration of a name used in a template definition, the usual lookup rules (ยง3.4.1, ยง3.4.2)
  are used for non-dependent names. The lookup of names dependent on the template parameters is postponed until the 
  actual template argument is known (ยง14.6.2)."

The first call to adl is a non-dependent call, so it is looked up at the time of definition of the function template.
The resolution of the second call is deferred until the template is instantiated because it depends on a template parameter.

    template<typename T> void call_adl_function(T t)
    {
        adl(S()); // Independent, looks up adl now.
        adl(t); // Dependent, looks up adl later.
    }

When adl is being looked up at the time of definition of the function template, the only version of adl that exists is 
the templated adl(T). Specifically, adl(S) does not exist yet, and is not a candidate.

Note: At the time of writing, this program does not confirm to the standard in some recent versions of Visual Studio's
C++ compiler.
